### Description 
Polish regulations require at least 3 hours of sunlight on the equinox day between 7.00 and 17.00 in the living space. This can be halved to 1,5 hours in 1 room apartments. The project is considered to comply with regulations when at least one window (point on a window) in the whole flat receives this amount of sunlight.

The colors have been selected on the legend to show those exact numbers - Yellow-Orange - over 3 hours. Blue - 1.5 to 3 hours. Violet-Black - below 1.5 hours.
